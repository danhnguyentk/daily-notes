# Always prefer enums for discrete option sets
rules:
  - match: "**/*.ts"
    instructions: |
      When adding fields or constants that take a small fixed set of values,
      define/extend a TypeScript enum (or string union if better) instead of
      repeating literal strings. Wire new fields to those enums.

  - match: "src/types/orderTypes.ts"
    instructions: |
      HARSI-related options must come from the Harsi8hColor enum (Green, Red, Neutral).
      Add future status/flag options as enums too.
